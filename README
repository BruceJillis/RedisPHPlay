Overview
========
   The RedisPHPlay library is geared towards being usable in development. This is represent in a few ways: All validation exceptions have 1 supertype RedisValidationException, making them easy 
   to catch. All other exceptions are RedisExceptions. Everything is documented. All input is validated. All output is as typefull as possible. Speed, the library tries to use memory as efficient
   as possible. Completenes, the library tries to implement all redis commands and to encapsulate best practices surrounding it.
